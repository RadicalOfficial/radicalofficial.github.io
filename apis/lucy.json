{"theory": "Lucy Loud from The Loud House is a demon. How? Well, a human being cannot teleport. Yes, I know it's cartoon logic but because of how Lucy is, she's the only one that can canonically do it. DISCLAIMER: This is only about Lucy Loud, not her friends. It is unknown whether or not they are also demons. Most likely not.\n\n\nIn one of the episodes, it is shown that she has a book containing spells. The books are unreadable because they contain some sort of demon language. She also likes to make fake blood and corpses but this could be actual blood. Additionally, albeit very difficult to notice, she doesn't have a reflection when she is around a mirror. You probably don't know but she might be hiding the dead souls and bodies. With this theory, it might be possible that Lucy Loud killed someone, ate them, and called it 'blood sausage'. "}
