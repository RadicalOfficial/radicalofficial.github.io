# What happened?
I've been working on too many projects at once that it's been a real struggle to create and release these projects. This problem started when Stickman Quest was left unfinished on April 20th, 2023.
Nearly **10 months** of the situation and no solution. There's also school which sometimes gets in the way of things. Here's a list of projects I have been trying to maintain for the past 10 months.

**Stickman Quest** - This game has 4 areas. The last one being unfinished.<br>
**Websites and Web Development** - I love doing this. But I have a lot of projects associated with this and it's hard to run one and another.
<br>
**RPG** - I started art work for an RPG since September of 2023. This project is ahead of all the rest.

The RPG will be the first to be finished, while the rest will be done after the RPG. 
Stickman Quest had to be cut short in development *Intentional Release: September 2023* due to life hitting me a bit harder than usual.

# Other Problems
I also have been stressed from school which was the main cause of the projects not being made.

# The RPG
The project started on September 3rd, 2023 at 1:43AM EST. The ideas came in roughly 1 week after while watching episodes of a cartoon. The name of the RPG is based off of a character from the cartoon. I, Knightbot63, will not say anything related to the RPG until the release.
## Inspiration
I really didn't know what to add or what type of genre the game should be. Since I haven't seen any RPGs on the Trending pages of Scratch, I wanted to make one to be a bit more creative than those generic cubic games. Roughly a few days of thinking, I wanted to combine Yo-Kai Watch and Undertale with Link's Awakening and see what the result would be; Hence the objects in the game being similar to the ones in those games. Link's Awakening would be one of the heaviest elements being in the RPG, while Undertale would be the battling mechanics and Yo-Kai Watch being the NPC names.
<br>I started making an RPG engine 2 months ago as of writing. There was no scrolling but a basic 1 screen room system. I remember in September that I made a few items:<br>
"Choco Bar," "Sword" (Unfinished) and some other dummy items.

<br>The Choco Bar being the first as it's supposed to resemble the very few items you'll commonly see in stores in Yo-Kai Watch. Haven't played the game in 7 years but was nostalgic.

# School Projects
I have to write a Career Research Draft/Essay on what I'm going to do as a career by going to specific colleges like Tech. <br>
...I just don't know what to write about
# Conclusion
As of July 2023, I have been mostly inactive on Scratch but I'm active on the unmoderated chat site. But I can be active on Scratch from time-to-time
