/**
 * A cargo of tasks for the worker function to complete. Cargo inherits all of
 * the same methods and event callbacks as [`queue`]{@link module:ControlFlow.queue}.
 * @typedef {Object} CargoObject
 * @memberOf module:ControlFlow
 * @property {Function} length - A function returning the number of items
 * waiting to be processed. Invoke like `cargo.length()`.
 * @property {number} payload - An `integer` for determining how many tasks
 * should be process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is
 * created to alter the payload on-the-fly.
 * @property {Function} push - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is
 * called once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a
 * single task, an array of `tasks` can be submitted. The respective callback is
 * used for every task in the list. Invoke like `cargo.push(task, [callback])`.
 * @property {Function} saturated - A callback that is called when the
 * `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.
 * @property {Function} empty - A callback that is called when the last item
 * from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.
 * @property {Function} drain - A callback that is called when the last item
 * from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.
 * @property {Function} idle - a function returning false if there are items
 * waiting or being processed, or true if not. Invoke like `cargo.idle()`.
 * @property {Function} pause - a function that pauses the processing of tasks
 * until `resume()` is called. Invoke like `cargo.pause()`.
 * @property {Function} resume - a function that resumes the processing of
 * queued tasks when the queue is paused. Invoke like `cargo.resume()`.
 * @property {Function} kill - a function that removes the `drain` callback and
 * empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go
